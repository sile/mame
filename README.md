This library provides common building blocks to build TUI (Terminal User Interface) applications.

"mame (è±†)" means "bean" in Japanese.
Just like beans are versatile ingredients that can be transformed into countless dishes - from miso soup to tofu, from coffee to chocolate -
this library provides flexible, composable components that can be combined to create diverse TUI applications.
