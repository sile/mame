This library provides common building blocks to build TUI (Terminal User Interface) applications.

"mame (è±†)" means "bean" in Japanese.
Just like beans are versatile ingredients that can be transformed into countless dishes - from miso soup to tofu, from coffee to chocolate -
this library provides flexible, composable components that can be combined to create diverse TUI applications.

## Features

### Input Binding System
- **Mouse and Keyboard Support**: Handle both keyboard events (keys, modifiers) and mouse events (clicks, scrolling, dragging)
- **Configurable Input Bindings**: Define custom input bindings with JSON/JSONC configuration files using the `triggers` field
- **Context-Aware Bindings**: Support for multiple input contexts with different binding sets that can be switched at runtime
- **Input Pattern Matching**: Flexible input parsing supporting:
  - Keyboard: modifiers (`C-c`, `M-x`), special keys (`<UP>`, `<ENTER>`), printable characters, and hex notation (`0x7f`)
  - Mouse: clicks (`<LEFTCLICK>`, `<RIGHTCLICK>`), scrolling (`<SCROLLUP>`, `<SCROLLDOWN>`), and dragging (`<DRAG>`)
- **Binding Tracking**: Track the last processed input and successfully matched binding with unique identifiers

### Terminal Utilities
- **Unicode-Aware Rendering**: Proper handling of wide characters (CJK, emojis) and zero-width characters
- **Terminal Frames**: Built on [tuinix](https://crates.io/crates/tuinix) with Unicode width estimation
- **Column Calculation**: Accurate display width calculation for international text

### UI Components
- **Legend Rendering**: Create bordered legend boxes for displaying input binding help with automatic sizing
- **File Preview**: Side-by-side file preview panes with automatic layout

### Command Execution
- **External Commands**: Execute system commands with configurable stdin/stdout/stderr handling

### Configuration
- **JSONC Support**: JSON with comments for human-friendly configuration files
- **Variable Resolution**: Template variables with environment variable support
- **Binding Structure**: Updated configuration format using `bindings` instead of `keybindings`, with `triggers` arrays for each binding

### Formatting Utilities
- **Input Display**: Format both keyboard and mouse inputs for display purposes
- **Flexible Padding**: Create padded strings with customizable characters
